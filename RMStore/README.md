#RMStore
<!--- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robotmedia/RMStore.png)](https://travis-ci.org/robotmedia/RMStore) -->


A lightweight iOS library for In-App Purchases.

RMStore adds [blocks](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#storekit-with-blocks) and [notifications](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#notifications) to StoreKit, plus [receipt verification](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#receipt-verification) and [transaction persistence](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#transaction-persistence). All in one class without external dependencies. Purchasing a product is as simple as:

```objective-c
[[RMStore defaultStore] addPayment:productID success:^(SKPaymentTransaction *transaction) {
    NSLog(@"Purchased!");
} failure:^(SKPaymentTransaction *transaction, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Something went wrong");
}];
```

##Add RMStore to your project

1. Add [`RMStore.h`](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/RMStore/RMStore.h) and [`RMStore.m`](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/RMStore/RMStore.m)
2. Link `StoreKit.framework`
3. Profit!

##StoreKit with blocks

RMStore adds blocks to all asynchronous StoreKit operations.

###Requesting products

```objective-c
NSSet *products = [NSSet setWithArray:@[@"fabulousIdol", @"rootBeer", @"rubberChicken"]];
[[RMStore defaultStore] requestProducts:products success:^(NSArray *products, NSArray *invalidProductIdentifiers) {
    NSLog(@"Products loaded");
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Something went wrong");
}];
```

###Add payment

```objective-c
[[RMStore defaultStore] addPayment:@"waxLips" success:^(SKPaymentTransaction *transaction) {
    NSLog(@"Product purchased");
} failure:^(SKPaymentTransaction *transaction, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Something went wrong");
}];
```

###Restore transactions

```objective-c
[[RMStore defaultStore] restoreTransactionsOnSuccess:^{
    NSLog(@"Transactions restored");
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Something went wrong");
}];
```

###Refresh receipt (iOS 7+ only)

```objective-c
[[RMStore defaultStore] refreshReceiptOnSuccess:^{
    NSLog(@"Receipt refreshed");
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Something went wrong");
}];
```

##Notifications

RMStore sends notifications of StoreKit related events and extends `NSNotification` to provide relevant information. To receive them, implement the desired methods of the `RMStoreObserver` protocol and add the observer to `RMStore`.

###Adding and removing the observer

```objective-c
[[RMStore defaultStore] addStoreObserver:self];
...
[[RMStore defaultStore] removeStoreObserver:self];
```

###Products request notifications

```objective-c
- (void)storeProductsRequestFailed:(NSNotification*)notification
{
    NSError *error = notification.storeError;
}

- (void)storeProductsRequestFinished:(NSNotification*)notification 
{
    NSArray *products = notification.products;
    NSArray *invalidProductIdentifiers = notification.invalidProductIdentififers;
}
```

###Payment transaction notifications

Payment transaction notifications are sent after a payment has been requested or for each restored transaction.

```objective-c
- (void)storePaymentTransactionFailed:(NSNotification*)notification
{
    NSError *error = notification.storeError;
    NSString *productIdentifier = notification.productIdentifier;
    SKPaymentTransaction *transaction = notification.transaction;
}

- (void)storePaymentTransactionFinished:(NSNotification*)notification
{
    NSString *productIdentifier = notification.productIdentifier;
    SKPaymentTransaction *transaction = notification.transaction;
}
```

###Restore transactions notifications

```objective-c
- (void)storeRestoreTransactionsFailed:(NSNotification*)notification;
{
    NSError *error = notification.storeError;
}

- (void)storeRestoreTransactionsFinished:(NSNotification*)notification { }
```

###Refresh receipt notifications (iOS 7+ only)

```objective-c
- (void)storeRefreshReceiptFailed:(NSNotification*)notification;
{
    NSError *error = notification.storeError;
}

- (void)storeRefreshReceiptFinished:(NSNotification*)notification { }
```

##Receipt verification

RMStore doesn't perform receipt verification by default but provides reference implementations. You can implement your own custom verification or use the reference verificators provided by the library.

Both options are outlined below. For more info, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/wiki/Receipt-verification). 

###Reference verificators

RMStore provides receipt verification via `RMStoreAppReceiptVerificator` (for iOS 7 or higher) and `RMStoreTransactionReceiptVerificator` (for iOS 6 or lower). To use any of them, add the corresponding files from [RMStore/Optional](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/tree/master/RMStore/Optional) into your project and set the verificator delegate (`receiptVerificator`) at startup. For example:

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    const BOOL iOS7OrHigher = floor(NSFoundationVersionNumber) > NSFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_6_1;
    _receiptVerificator = iOS7OrHigher ? [[RMStoreAppReceiptVerificator alloc] init] : [[RMStoreTransactionReceiptVerificator alloc] init];
    [RMStore defaultStore].receiptVerificator = _receiptVerificator;
    // Your code
    return YES;
}
```

If security is a concern you might want to avoid using an open source verification logic, and provide your own custom verificator instead.

###Custom verificator

RMStore delegates receipt verification, enabling you to provide your own implementation using  the `RMStoreReceiptVerificator` protocol:

```objective-c
- (void)verifyTransaction:(SKPaymentTransaction*)transaction
                           success:(void (^)())successBlock
                           failure:(void (^)(NSError *error))failureBlock;
```

Call `successBlock` if the receipt passes verification, and `failureBlock` if it doesn't. If verification could not be completed (e.g., due to connection issues), then `error` must be of code `RMStoreErrorCodeUnableToCompleteVerification` to prevent RMStore to finish the transaction.

You will also need to set the `receiptVerificator` delegate at startup, as indicated above.

##Transaction persistence

RMStore delegates transaction persistence and provides two optional reference implementations for storing transactions in the Keychain or in `NSUserDefaults`. You can implement your transaction, use the reference implementations provided by the library or, in the case of non-consumables and auto-renewable subscriptions, get the transactions directly from the receipt.

For more info, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/wiki/Transaction-persistence).

##Requirements

RMStore requires iOS 5.0 or above and ARC.

If you are using RMStore in your non-ARC project, you will need to set a `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag on all of the RMStore source files.

##Roadmap

RMStore is in early stage and currently supports consumables and non-consumables only. Future enhancements will include:

* [Content download support](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/issues/2)
* [Better subcriptions support](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/issues/3)
* [Better OS X support](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/issues/4)
